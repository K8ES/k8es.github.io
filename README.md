# K8ES Amateur Radio Club Website

Welcome to the K8ES Amateur Radio Club website repository! This site is a resource for Amateur Radio operators and members of the K8ES community to share information, updates, and resources related to our passion for ham radio. We encourage all club members and radio enthusiasts to contribute to growing and improving this site.

This README provides a quick guide on how to submit **Issues** and **Pull Requests (PRs)** to help enhance the K8ES website.

## Getting Started

To contribute, you'll need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one, [sign up here](https://github.com/join). No advanced coding skills are required—just a willingness to share ideas and improve our community’s online presence!

## Submitting Issues

If you spot a problem, have a suggestion, or want to propose new content (e.g., event announcements, technical guides, or club updates), you can submit an **Issue**:

1. **Navigate to the Issues Tab**:
   - Go to the [K8ES GitHub repository](https://github.com/K8ES/k8es.github.io) and click on the **Issues** tab.
   
2. **Create a New Issue**:
   - Click the green **New Issue** button.
   - Provide a clear title (e.g., "Add Field Day 2025 details" or "Fix broken link on Resources page").
   - Describe the issue or idea in detail in the description box. For example:
     - What’s the problem or suggestion?
     - Which page or section is affected?
     - Any specific details (e.g., for content updates, include text or links you’d like to add).
   - Submit the issue by clicking **Submit new issue**.

3. **Engage with the Community**:
   - Club maintainers will review your issue and may ask for clarification or discuss implementation.

Issues are a great way to suggest content like new pages for radio projects, QSL card designs, or local event recaps without writing code.

## Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

If you’re comfortable making changes to the website (e.g., editing text, adding images, or updating HTML/CSS), you can submit a **Pull Request (PR)**.
